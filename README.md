## üì¶ How to use:
You need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

Clone the project.

Install required packages into the project:
  ```bash
npm install
  ```

Now copy the .env.example file to **.env** file to the project:
  ```.bash
copy .env.example .env
  ```

Now, you need to create a bot in the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Click on New Application and give it a cool name.
On the **General Information** tab copy the APPLICATION ID and past on the CLIENT_ID variable on .env file, like this example: 

  ```.env
TOKEN=
CLIENT_ID=0123456789876543210
  ```

Now, on the **Bot** tab, click on "Reset Token" to generate a new `Token`. 
Copy the `token` to the .env file:
> Remember, it's crucial not to share this token with anyone else.

The `.env` file should be like this example:
  ```.env
TOKEN=EXAMPLE01234TOKEN
CLIENT_ID=0123456789876543210
  ```

**THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP:**

On the 'OAuth2' tab, under the 'OAuth2 URL Generator' session, select **bot** and **applications.commands**. Then, in the 'BOT PERMISSIONS' section, check the **Administrator** checkbox. This will generate the link to add the bot to a server. Simply paste the generated link into your browser to add the bot to your server.

Now, run the command:
   ```js
npm start
  ```


The bot is now up and running! Head over to your server and enjoy it!

Notice: The bot may take up to 5 minutes to register the commands.

> Once it's running, you can add the bot to multiple servers, and it will work seamlessly on all of them.
