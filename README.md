## üì¶ How to use:
You need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

Clone the project.

Install required packages into the project:
  ```bash
npm install
  ```

Now copy the .env.example file to **.env** file to the project:
  ```.bash
copy .env.example .env
  ```

Now, you need to create a bot in the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
Click on New Applcation and give it a cool name.
On the **General Information** tab copy the APPLICATION ID and past on the CLIENT_ID variable on .env file, live this example: 

  ```.env
TOKEN=
CLIENT_ID=0123456789876543210
  ```

Now, on the **Bot** tab click on Reset Token and generate a new `Token`. (Do not share this token!)
Copy the `token` to the .env file:

The `.env` file should be like this example:
  ```.env
TOKEN=EXAMPLE01234TOKEN
CLIENT_ID=0123456789876543210
  ```

**THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP:**

On the 'OAuth2' tab, on the session 'OAuth2 URL Generator' select `bot` and `applications.commands` then in the session 'BOT PERMISSIONS' select `Administrator` checkbox. 
This will generate the link to add the bot to a server. Paste it on a browser to add the bot to your server.

Now, run the command:
   ```js
npm start
  ```

The bot is now running, go to your server and enjoy it!
The bot can take up to 5 minutes to have the commands registered.
